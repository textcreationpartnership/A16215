            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Be ready alwayes to give an anſwer to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meekneſſe and feare.</hi> The multitude of my thoughts thereof, have conſtrained me to give ſome publicke teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whereby to abſolve my ſelfe from any ſiniſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of that retired privacy which I have hitherto injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I chuſe rather to have my life embrightened by uſe, than conſumed by the
<pb facs="tcp:14543:3"/> ruſt of eaſe. There is no kind of life ſo meane and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as that of the voluptuous man, who filleth himſelfe with vaine delights, as with the wind, and hath no other pleaſure than that which is common to the creatures, yea more proper to them than unto man; not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be called a life, for ſuch as live in pleaſure are dead while they live. Other profeſſions, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in themſelves, ſo being rightly uſed, they may become helpfull unto us, in making our calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure. There is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing beſtowed upon the Peace-maker, which labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to deſtroy that bitter roote of diſſention, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
<pb facs="tcp:14543:3"/> goodwil among men: But let him conſider how miſerable an eſtate he is in, though hee hath beene an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of concord, and a meanes of charity, if hee wants this inward peace of a good conſcience; and the perfect aſſurance that God is reconciled unto him in Chriſt Ieſus. The Ruler muſt remember how inexcuſable he is, if he condemneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in doing the ſame things wherein hee judgeth another: How can hee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſwearing and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in other men, when himſelfe doth deſerve to be ſmitten five or ſix times, even till hee bee conſumed, with the arrowes of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, becauſe of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions?
<pb facs="tcp:14543:4"/> The Advocate that ſeekes for the temporall benefit of another man, with ſuch vehemency, may be put in minde to ſue for his owne ſpirituall good, with greater importunity: If hee bee ſo diligent to obtaine a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible reward, then hee ought to bee much more carefull to obtaine an incorruptible crowne, which is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than gold or ſilver; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given unto us by Chriſt our Mediator, who pleadeth for us, and in whom wee alſo have boldneſſe and acceſſe with confidence unto the throne of grace. The Soule-phyſitian muſt firſt heale himſelfe, before he can cure the infirmities of other men: And his chiefe care and feare
<pb facs="tcp:14543:4"/> muſt bee, leſt that by any meanes, having preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, he himſelfe ſhould be a caſt away: Thus ſhould the ſoule bee lifted up in all our employments. But the common courſe of the world is to lanch forth into the deepe, not having Chriſt to bee their Pilot; where they are exceedingly toſſed by ſtormy winds, and mighty tempeſts, and in danger to fall into quick-ſands, or at leaſt to bee prevented by the winter of ſickneſſe and death, ſo that their voyage is with much hurt and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and ſometime they make ſhip-wracke of faith and a good conſcience. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the true beleever hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the faire havens of
<pb facs="tcp:14543:5"/> bleſſedneſſe and tranquility: Hee onely is rapt up to ſuch an height, that hee is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the harmfull vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of thunder and raine. His underſtanding is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-clouded with darke ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: Hee is not carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about with every winde of inconſtancy, But having found by comfortable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that it is good being upon this holy hill; hee hath there pitched his tent, and fixed his habitation. From whence God ſuffereth him to looke downe, upon the Gomorrah of this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious people, this ſinfull world: The cry of whoſe grievous ſinnes, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, doth aſcend up like a vapour, and will cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:14543:5"/> the Lord to ſhowre downe his judgements.</p>
            <p>The good man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon God alone,<note place="margin">Pro. 14.14.</note> and is ſatisfied from himſelfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving full contentment in the portion received, is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of all men moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Were not the deceitfull heart like that bag with holes (whereof the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) which can never be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">Haggai 1.6.</note> this competent eſtate, for which Agur prayed, and for which we ought to give thankes, might bring abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfaction, and cauſe us to ſeeke more devoutly for heavenly bleſſings. The chiefe contentment I have found in framing this ſmall worke, may be expreſſed in the words of Iacob, though
<pb facs="tcp:14543:6"/> with plainer truth, The Lord thy God brought it to my hand: My ſpeciall benefit which I intend, is to bind my ſelfe to a vigilant obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe things, which I have thought meet and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to preſcribe unto others: If hereby any glory doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound unto God, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the prize for which I runne: As for any fame unto my ſelfe, I neither deſerve nor expect it: And though it were never ſo well beautified by Art, and adorned with Rhetorick, I would ſhake it off as the duſt, and tread it under foot, rather than be ſeduced with fond affectation of empty praiſe. I regard not mans day, nor will I hearken unto the voyce of man,
<pb facs="tcp:14543:6"/> when (as I hope) God himſelfe hath called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

In the former part, I will ſay unto God, My rocke; There is a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Gods mercy, which emboldened him thus to ſpeake: In the latter, Why haſt thou forgotten me?

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14543:179"/> their reproach, and turne it upon their owne head: We may demand the cauſe of this their inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Where is thy God?

Had they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have taken his yoke upon them, David would willingly have inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them in the way, yea hee would have beene their guide; Come and ſee Him, who hath told me all things that I know,<note place="margin">&amp; 4.29.</note> and knoweth all things that ever I did; is not this the only true God? But they meant to honour him no otherwiſe than Herod thought to worſhip Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.7.</note> when he enquired diligently after him: He hoped to have
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:14543:180"/> killed the Lord of life, and they purpoſe to doe no leſſe, comming out with ſwords,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.55.</note> as againſt a theefe; though they aime at the members, yet they ſmite the head it ſelfe in their perſecution:<note place="margin">Act. 9.4, 5.</note> What is done to one of thoſe little ones, is done unto Chriſt; and what is done to Chriſt, is done to one of them. A ſervant of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heare His holy name, which wee ought not to uſe without great reverence, to bee diſhonoured, but his righteous ſoule muſt be vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereat. It was this which did ſtrike ſo deepe into Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and vexe him ſo ſore: See the coherence which hee makes in the ſame verſe;<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.9.</note> For the zeale of thine houſe hath

How free hee was from anger and revenge in his owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe, may appeare by his carriage when Saul had a quarrell againſt him: For though Saul had ſo highly offended God by his folly, in offering a burnt offering, for the which hee was told that his kingdome ſhould not continue; God having ſought a man after his owne heart: And againe hee rebelled by diſobedience, in ſparing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag, &amp; the beſt of the ſpoile; at which time the Prophet threatned him, that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhould bee rent away from him. And though Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was anoynted by Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:14543:181"/> and might have ſet upon Saul, when hee cut the skirt of his robe privily; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time might have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Abiſhai to ſmite him, and make him ſleepe his laſt; yet hee would not upon theſe pretences put forth his hand againſt him, but lamented at his death, and calls to the daughters of Iſrael to weepe over Saul. But here, when God was contemned, he was pricked to the heart, and his marrow was turned into the drought of Summer: He was upon the racke, and all his bones were broken, when he heard their evill ſpeeches, whereby they infected the ayre, and poyſoned their owne ſoules. Now between David and moſt men living
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14543:181"/> in theſe daies, there is as great a difference, as betweene the King upon the throne, and the meaneſt ſubject grinding at the mill: Hee had a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne command over him ſelfe, and was ſlow to anger, not ſinning by wrath, yet moſt ſenſible o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>VVHereas David ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeateth theſe words, we may obſerve the manifold troubles which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us in this life. Having mentioned his teates, and his baniſhment in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at the fift verſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes his ſoule for ſadneſſe; Having rehearſed his other afflictions, he now againe chides himſelfe for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull heavineſſe: As Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Mat. 14.30.</note> though he began to ſinke the firſt time hee went to Chriſt upon the water, Yet he was not thereby diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from caſting himſelfe into the ſea againe;<note place="margin">Iohn 21.7.</note> and then
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14543:183"/> he paſſed ſafely to the ſhoare where Chriſt was: So though the waves &amp; billowes went over David, when hee hoped to approch unto God by faith, yet here againe hee calls upon his ſoule, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting himſelfe upon Gods mercy, he arrives at the port of bleſſedneſſe: Hee did not overcome theſe temptations and trialls, at the firſt aſſault, nor yet was he wearied with the continuance of them; But whenſoever he was mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with any evill, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to ſtrengthen his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Gods love, that he may be reſtored to comfort.

               <p>By this we may learne that leſſon, which we ſhall have cauſe to remember, and occaſion to practice, That through much tribulation we muſt enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven:<note place="margin">Act. 14.22. 2.

Wee may take this one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for an example of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering affliction; yet did hee not caſt away his confidence, but hoped in God: therfore let us alſo hold faſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith.<note place="margin">Iam 5.7.</note> Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, untill hee receiue the earely and later raine: let us alſo ſtabliſh our hearts, that wee may bee refreſhed with
